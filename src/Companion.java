//10 Create an interface named Companion. The Companion interface should specify an instance method named snuggle that has no arguments and returns a String. Change your PetDog class so it implements the Companion interface. The implementation of the snuggle method on the PetDog class should return "name wants to snuggle", where name is the inherited instance property.
public interface Companion {
    public String snuggle();
}
